Wireframing helps designers structure a webpage before implementation. It provides a clear layout for content organization and usability. It can be low-fidelity(basic sketches) or high-fidelity(detailed digital versions).

One key takeaway is that wireframes should prioritize content hierarchy and ensure accessibility. For my recipe page, I plan to focus on making ingredients and steps easy to find. Initially, I focused only on the recipe content, but later realized that adding a sidebar for related recipes made the layout more dynamic.
