    <h1>High School Artwork</h1>
    <p class="description">
        During the summer before high school, I discovered a deep fascination with oil painting.  
        It was a new language, distinct from the delicate fluidity of ink, yet equally expressive.  
        I began with simple studies, carefully replicating masterworks to understand composition, color harmony, and texture.  
        As my confidence grew, so did my canvases, expanding from small exercises to larger, more personal creations.
        I embrace the meditative process of bringing an idea to life.
