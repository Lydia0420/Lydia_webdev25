    <h1>Elementary School Artwork</h1>
    <p class="description">
        An unexpected encounter led me to my first mentor in traditional Chinese painting, an art form known as "Danqing", where ink and brush breathe life into paper.
        Under my teacher's guidance, I embarked on my artistic journey, immersing myself in the graceful yet disciplined world of ink wash painting. 
        I learned to balance light and dark, motion and stillness, capturing fleeting moments of nature with delicate strokes. 
        This experience marked the true beginning of my exploration in the arts.
