            This piece marks my first attempt at fashion design, not just sketching ideas, but bringing them to life.       
            As a child, I once dreamed of becoming a fashion designer.       
            During the COVID-19 lockdown in Shanghai, I turned that childhood vision into reality.       
            This dress became more than just fabric and stitches, it was my way of creating something meaningful in uncertain times.       
            A personal milestone, a gift to my 17-year-old self.
